# GitHub API Optimization Improvements

## What was improved:

### 1. **Server-side Caching**
- Added 5-minute cache for user data and repository data
- Prevents redundant API calls within the cache window
- Reduces latency and GitHub API rate limit usage

### 2. **Request Deduplication**
- Prevents multiple simultaneous requests to the same endpoint
- Uses a pending requests map to deduplicate identical API calls
- Ensures only one request is made even if multiple functions call it simultaneously

### 3. **Rate Limiting Protection**
- Built-in rate limiter that respects GitHub's 60 requests/hour limit (for unauthenticated) or 5000/hour (authenticated)
- Automatically waits when approaching rate limits
- Prevents 403 rate limit errors

### 4. **Optimized Token Validation**
- Reuses user data fetch for validation instead of making separate API calls
- Caches validation results to avoid redundant checks
- Reduces total API calls significantly

### 5. **Parallel Processing**
- Fetches user data and repositories in parallel when both are needed
- Improves overall response time

### 6. **Better Error Handling**
- More specific error messages
- Graceful fallbacks when API calls fail
- Proper cache cleanup on errors

### 7. **Enhanced Security**
- **Token URL Cleanup**: Automatically removes sensitive tokens from URL query parameters after processing
- **Secure Cookie Storage**: Tokens are stored in secure HTTP-only cookies instead of being exposed in URLs
- **No Token Exposure**: Prevents tokens from appearing in browser history, logs, or being accidentally shared

## Security Improvements:

### Token URL Cleanup
```typescript
// Before: Token visible in URL
/profile?token=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

// After: Token automatically removed from URL
/profile
```

### Implementation Details:
- Custom hook `useRemoveTokenFromUrl()` automatically cleans URLs
- Tokens are processed and then immediately removed from query parameters
- Uses `router.replace()` to update URL without navigation
- Prevents tokens from being visible in browser history
- Secure cookie storage instead of URL parameters

### Usage:
```typescript
// In any component that processes tokens
import { useRemoveTokenFromUrl } from '@/hooks/use-cleanup-query-params'

function MyComponent() {
  const [tokenProcessed, setTokenProcessed] = useState(false)

  // Remove token from URL after processing
  useRemoveTokenFromUrl(tokenProcessed)

  // ... rest of component logic
}
```

## Performance Comparison:

### Before (Multiple API calls):
```
1. /api/github/user route called
2. GET https://api.github.com/user (for user data)
3. GET https://api.github.com/user/repos (paginated, potentially multiple calls)
4. If validation is called separately: GET https://api.github.com/user (again)

Total: 3+ API calls for a single user fetch operation
```

### After (Optimized):
```
1. /api/github/user route called
2. Check cache first (no API call if cached)
3. If not cached: Parallel fetch of user + repos
4. Subsequent calls within 5 minutes: Served from cache (0 API calls)
5. Validation reuses existing user data

Total: 2 API calls maximum for initial fetch, 0 for subsequent calls within cache window
```

## Usage Examples:

### Using the new GitHub API client:
```typescript
import { githubAPI } from '@/utils/github-api'

// Fetch user with automatic caching
const user = await githubAPI.fetchUser(token)

// Fetch everything at once (optimized)
const { user, repos, stats } = await githubAPI.fetchUserWithRepos(token)

// Validate token (reuses user fetch)
const isValid = await githubAPI.validateToken(token)

// Check cache statistics
const cacheStats = githubAPI.getCacheStats()
```

### Benefits for your application:
1. **Faster response times** - Cached responses are instant
2. **Reduced GitHub API usage** - Stays well within rate limits
3. **Better user experience** - No waiting for repeated API calls
4. **More reliable** - Built-in rate limiting prevents 403 errors
5. **Easier maintenance** - Centralized GitHub API logic
6. **Enhanced security** - Tokens are automatically removed from URLs and stored securely
7. **Better privacy** - No sensitive data in browser history or logs

The optimizations are particularly beneficial when:
- Users navigate between pages frequently
- Multiple components need user data
- The application makes frequent GitHub API calls
- You want to respect GitHub's rate limits
